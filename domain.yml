  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: "Coronaviruses are a type of virus. 
           There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. 
           A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19."
  
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, 
           sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols."
  
  utter_corona_vaccine:
  - text: "Equitable access to safe and efficetive vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemice
           so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccine proving and going to development.
           WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines."
  
  utter_corona_variants:
  - text: "All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. 
           Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, 
           such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, 
           therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures. "
